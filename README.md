## **Introduction**
Retinoblastoma is a rare but aggressive eye cancer, predominantly affecting children under the age of five. Early diagnosis is critical for preserving vision and improving survival rates. This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify eye images as either healthy or affected by retinoblastoma. The project integrates **PyTorch** for training, **data augmentation** for improved generalization, and a **Streamlit** interface for user-friendly, real-time predictions.

## **‚ú® Features**
- **Deep Learning Model**: Custom CNN for binary classification of eye images.
- **Eye Detection with Mediapipe**: Automatically detects and crops eye regions from face images for diagnosis.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like flipping, rotation, and cropping to enhance dataset variability.
- **Interactive Web App**: Upload an image and get predictions with confidence scores.
- **Balanced Loss Function**: Weighted loss to address class imbalance.
